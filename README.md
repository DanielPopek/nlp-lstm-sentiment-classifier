# Sentiment classification in NLP

## Intoduction:

The aim of this project was to implement recurrent neural networks based sentiment classifier on IMDB reviews dataset.

Main goal was to compare performance of RNN and LSTM cells. 
 
Two word embedding representations were used:

- randomized and learned as Embedding Layer
- Word2Vec pre-trained representation


## Subtasks: 

1. Implement from scratch the LSTM recursive network in Tensorflow.
2. Choose learning hyperparameters to maximize results.
3. Compare the LSTM network result with the simple recursive network. Evaluate the profit from the use of the LSTM cell in terms of:
   - the cost function curve depending on the epoch,
   - accuracy curve depending on the epoch and test and training sets.
